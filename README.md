## DataSet Details
This dataset contains information about the top 503 highest grossing holywood films.

## Analysis
I have processed the raw data using the Mapping technique and mapped two columns Title and Distributor. Now, we have Title coming from different Distributor. By using reducing technique, i have reduced data and displayed number of movies for each distributor.
